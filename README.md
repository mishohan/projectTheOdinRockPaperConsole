1. Please open the Console first. For windows: Ctrl + Shift + J . For Mac: Command + Option + C.
2. The input prompt is not case sensitive so you can write rock, paper, scissor using capslock or anyway you would like to spell.
3. Please don't use Simbles as input.
4. If the spelling is wrong, try again. It should work fine if you spell right afterwards.
